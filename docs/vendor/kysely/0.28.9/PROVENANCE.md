# Kysely docs snapshot provenance

This directory vendors a snapshot of Kysely documentation for use during implementation of this
rewrite. The authoritative Kysely docs for this repo are the files under this directory.

- Source repo: `https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely`
- Version tag: `v0.28.9`
- Tag commit: `f7ebe17b60e037c5589cfbebb3f5d061d5e307f1`
- Files included:
  - `README.md` + `LICENSE` from the Kysely repo root
  - documentation content from `site/docs/` (copied to `docs/` here)

If we upgrade `kysely`, refresh this snapshot to match the installed version (and update
`docs/runbooks/kysely.md` + the `kysely-workflows` skill accordingly).
